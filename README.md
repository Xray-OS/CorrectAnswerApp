# CorrectAnswerApp
This is an App that review your score based on the amount of total correct answers made by the user

# What is the correctAnswerApp?
The **correctAnswerApp**, is a very simple console application that i've created just hobby purposes, is a little project that i've created just for curiosity, and may be if i get better ideas i will improve the app made a little bit more interesting. 

When you run the code on your preferred **IDE**, it will ask you a couple questions, for every correct answer you input in to **consoleApp**, the code will generate a true state from a **bool** variable, that state will be added to a variable called **score**, and it will add just 1, but for every correct answer all the instances in which the **bool** variable was true will be added into the **score** variable, thus giving you the total score from the questionary.

Depending on your score, the **consoleApp** will give you some specific messages depending on your results, so better try to answer correctly as many questions as possible.

## CURRENT STATE
At the moment, the **correcttAnswerApp** is just a console application that can be useful to solve a very quick questionary, the code is not complex, is made in the most simple way, the code eventually will be improved
